        <h1>Analysis of Netflix's Webisite through the lens of UI and UX</h1>
        
       <p>Netflix is a streaming service that offers a subscription service in South Africa. Their website creates an incredibly good user experience through their UI but raises ethical concerns through addictive user behaviors. Firstly, Netflix is able to easily bring users to sign up through their well structured sign up pages that are simple, clear and comfortable for users. Secondly, the website's accessibility options have drastically improved to let visually, and hearing impaired people still watch their favorite shows through a changeable font size for captions. Lastly, Netflix creates personalized homepages to each profile according to a user's watch history. This gives users a much better experience and deviates from conventions used by other streaming services to create a more unique and effective user experience. However, the personalized algorithm raises ethical concerns with regards to addictive behaviors for users.

        <br/><br/>Netflix offers a subscription service to South Africans at R199 per month for users to watch their favorite shows. Following the basic principles of UI, Netflix does a fantastic job in creating a good user experience. This has allowed Netflix as a business to flourish and earn billions of dollars over the years. A touchpoint for Netflix's Website can be where users select their profile. Users are placed in the middle of the page to give a good understanding of what they must do. There is a big bold Text that asks the user “Who is watching?”, providing a clear understanding as to what users must do. The rest of the page is whitespace which creates a focus on the centre and gives clarity to the user. Furthermore, the page strives for simplicity. STUDIO’s webpage on the 14 basic design principles of UI states that simplicity allows for users to “easily understand and navigate the system” (According to UXPin (n.d.), there are several key principles of UI design, including "simplicity," "consistency," "visibility," and "feedback."), Netflix’s landing page successfully leaves out unnecessary elements on the screen and keeps the webpage simple to avoid confusion. Moreover, this page goes against convention. Most websites require users to log-in with an email and password that has 1 profile per user. Although Netflix has this too, Netflix saves their email and password and does not ask for it again unless users change their password. This skips an extra action that users would have to go through. Even though it is convention for sites to save emails and passwords to make users lives easier, they usually just autofill the fields and still require users to click sign in. 
        
        <br/><br/>This is where Netflix is able to create a better user experience. Not only do they skip the sign in step by automatically signing users in, but also allows a personalized experience for more than one profile under one account. This makes a customer's money more valuable since they can technically pay the amount for 1 subscription but have an entire family use it on different devices, personalized to each individual. With regards to Hassenzahl and Tractinsky 2nd aspect to UX, Netflix both falls short and excels in its contributing agents, user and context. Netflix’s accessibility has improved vastly over time. Closed captions and show descriptions are available in over 30 languages allowing people with impaired hearing to still enjoy amazing stories. Netflix browsing has also been made easy for people who struggle with vision. Tech Desk from The Indian Express states that for elderly people who may have glasses or imperfect eyes, watching a show with small subtitles may be difficult. This can be fixed by “increasing the size of the subtitles”  (Indian Express, 2020). Furthermore Tech Desk gives directions as to where the user can go to change this: “Account > Profile & Parental Controls > Subtitle Appearance” (Indian Express, 2020). This creates a much better user experience for those who have hearing or visual problems as they can still enjoy their favorite shows. However, the users context can influence their experience. Some of Netflix’s shows are region locked. This means that depending on the user's country, they may not be able to watch certain shows. For example, if a Netflix user lives in South Africa, they may not be able to access an American show. This is obviously frustrating for the user and results in a more negative user experience. 
        
        <br/><br/>Netflix’s expertise in UI design makes signing up extremely easy and quick and is a staple in their success today. Erica Shneider mentions that if the expectation of a user is high, and the “subjective value” (Shneider, 2023) is high then users will be more likely to follow through. She then gives an equation to Netflix’s success: “motivation = expectancy x value” (Shneider, 2023). Whilst signing up to Netflix, users are met with a screen to complete their profile. Centered, is text that says “step 1 of 3”. This makes users aware that the time this will take is short, and therefore increases expectancy. On the second screen users must choose their plan. Centered on the screen is text that reads “No commitments, cancel anytime”. This is smart because it gives the user a reason to try it. On the last screen they keep the steps in 3’s to keep the design engaging and compact. They provide users with the different plans information and give the users opportunity to opt out. This design makes certain that users are met with the last screen and are not interfered with if they wish to leave. The process to sign up to Netflix is fast, efficient and makes sure that users know what they are signing up for without hiding anything. Overall Netflix’s sign up creates an amazing first impression and creates a good user experience.
        
       <br/><br/> Netflix utilizes many conventions used on other streaming services, but also deviates from the norm to create a more unique and effective user experience. Just like other streaming services Netflix has a large video that plays on their homepage that features new or recommended shows. Netflix also autoplays trailers and has thumbnails for all their shows. These are all conventions that are considered the norm for streaming services. Mailloux states that “Conventions are not static norms, but living and evolving practices.” (Mailloux, 1983). As such, Netflix has also deviated from the norm in order to create an overall better user experience. Netflix has an extremely complex personalization algorithm that is unique to each profile that fits the needs of the user. It utilizes the users previously watched shows to recommend new shows that they are likely to enjoy. Furthermore, Netflix also has original content. Netflix heavily invests in creating new shows that are completely unique to their platform and are not available anywhere else. These deviations from the norm have helped Netflix create a more effective and unique user experience. By personalizing content and recommending new shows to users, and producing original content, Netflix is able to differentiate themselves from their competitors and create a completely different user experience that is tailored to the preferences and needs of the user.
        
        <br/><br/>Once you have created a Netflix account and are ready to watch shows, you are presented with your own homepage. Netflix uses horizontal sliders with headings such as “Trending Now”. In each horizontal slider there are thumbnails to different show’s, that when selected, the UI responds with the thumbnail slightly enlarging and playing the show's trailer. Users can then press a play button, an add to list button and an like button. These all let Netflix understand what the user likes and dislikes so that it can create a more tailored experience for the user. It takes users 2 clicks to watch a show and requires non-trivial effort. As shown by the thumbnails and buttons, their interaction design is responsive which enables users to traverse their system quickly and easily. Moreover, the interactions responses do not change when users are using a different device like an iPad or a Smart TV. This keeps users' expectations the same and makes sure that the site’s responses do not respond in a random fashion. Overall, the interaction design used for Netflix’s Website is responsive, does not respond in a completely random fashion, requires non-trivial effort and modifies text and images to let the user understand what to do and where they will be going.
        
        <br/><br/>Netflix has ethical concerns with regards to binge-watching and time spent on their platform. It is designed for people to sit and watch an entire season to become addicted to their shows from any location. This encourages people to rather watch Netflix and disregard their responsibilities, which leads to addictive behaviors. Firstly, Netflix releases shows on a season basis rather than an episode per week. This means that 8 - 12 episodes are released at one time. This encourages users to Binge-Watch content, especially if the user has been waiting for a new season to release. Not only this but built in their interaction design, there is an autoplay feature that starts the next episode without the user having to do anything. This makes their design require non-trivial effort which in text-books is better for their design but raises ethical concern. This can create addictive behaviors where users would rather spend time watching Netflix than spend their time on their responsibilities. Secondly, Netflix’s algorithms are complex and constantly recommend new content to users that suit their viewing needs. Although this is great for user experience it can cause users to spend more time than they intended on the platform as they continue to watch recommended content. Lastly, their platform is designed to be used on any platform making it easy for users to access it from any location at any time. This ease of access can make it difficult for users to take breaks from watching their favorite shows. Netflic’s design is not inherently addictive. However, by encouraging users to keep watching content through recommended content and the autoplay features can cause users to spend too much time on the platform even if they know they shouldn't, leading to addictive behaviors.
        
        <br/><br/>In conclusion, Netflix's website strives for simplicity and clarity for users to easily navigate through their pages and sign up while smartly making sure that the user can opt out at any time. Their accessibility options allow for the needs of different users that are impaired in some way to still be able to enjoy their service. Netflix deviates from streaming service convention by creating an unique and personalized experience through a smart algorithm that constantly recommends new and similar content based on what they previously watched. However, the auto-play feature alongside the personalization algorithm raises ethical concerns that may lead users to spend too much time on their platform without taking a break (binge-watching), leaving them to possibly disregard their responsibilities and become addicted to the platform.
